# SQL-Projects-Tasks-ITI

This repository contains a collection of SQL tasks and projects completed during my training at the Information Technology Institute (ITI). The focus was on mastering SQL fundamentals and advanced concepts through hands-on practice using Microsoft SQL Server.

## üìÅ File Descriptions

| File Name | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `Advanced SQL Operations and Constraints Practice.sql` | Includes advanced SQL operations along with table-level and column-level constraints such as `CHECK`, `DEFAULT`, `NOT NULL`, and `UNIQUE`. |
| `Advanced SQL Queries and Aggregations.sql` | Contains complex SQL queries using `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, aggregations, grouping, and conditional filtering. |
| `Advanced SQL Views, Indexing, Merge & Cursors.sql` | A consolidated file demonstrating the creation of `VIEWS`, implementation of `INDEXES`, `MERGE` statements, and usage of cursors in SQL. |
| `SQL Constraints and Schema Operations Task.sql` | Exercises focusing on schema-level operations and applying various constraints on tables. |
| `SQL Functions Practice and Data Operations.sql` | Covers scalar functions, data transformation, filtering, and sorting operations using SQL built-in functions. |
| `SQL Queries and Data Manipulation Practice.sql` | Includes simple to intermediate `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` queries for practice. |
| `SQL User Defined Types and Table Constraints.sql` | Demonstrates how to use user-defined data types and apply constraints like `PRIMARY KEY` and `FOREIGN KEY`. |
| `SQL Views Creation and Manipulation Practice.sql` | Practice creating and querying views, with examples of filtering, altering, and dropping views. |
| `SQL Views Indexes Merge and Cursors.sql` | Combines examples of indexed views, merging data from different tables, and cursor logic in SQL Server. |
| `SQL Views with GO and Update Examples.sql` | Shows how to use `GO` batches and update data using views with `WITH CHECK OPTION`. |
| `Views Indexes Merge and Cursors Refined.sql` | A polished and structured version that combines advanced usage of views, indexes, merge, and cursors into one complete task file. |
